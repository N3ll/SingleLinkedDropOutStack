Exercise description 

A drop-out stack is like an ordinary stack, except that the element at the bottom of the stack is dropped, when a new element is pushed to the top of full stack (the stack has a limited capacity of n elements).

Implement a drop-out stack using a single-linked list. 

Create a test program to test your drop-out stack.
